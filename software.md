- **Input:**
This software has been meticulously engineered to seamlessly process 2D point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) images, which are formatted as `.png` or `.jpg` files. These images exhibit dimensions of (x, y, 3), allowing for variations in size, and are fundamental to the core functionality of the software.


## Methodology

- **YOLOv8 Training**: We trained the YOLOv8 model using a limited set of 100 images and masks from each modality to generate boundary boxes.

- **Segmentation Models**: We implemented the SAM and HQ-SAM models for precise ROI segmentation. 

## Results and Evaluation

We extensively evaluated our approach using various metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and Dice Score, to quantify segmentation accuracy. 


## Key Findings

- **SAM Outperforms**: The SAM model exhibited higher segmentation accuracy and overall performance compared to the other models.

- **HQ-SAM**: While HQ-SAM offers potential advantages, its incremental gains over the standard SAM model may not justify the additional computational cost.

## Conclusion

Our findings suggest that the YOLOv8+SAM model holds promise for enhancing medical image segmentation and its clinical implications.
